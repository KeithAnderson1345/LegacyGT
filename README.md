---

**Description:**<br>
This project is being created to help a person or group organize a golf tournament. The goal is to have a web interface that will allow Players, Sponsors, and Volunteers to register using their custom username and password. Each user will be able to select various items upon registration for the tournament depending on which type of user they are (Player, Sponsor, Volunteer).
